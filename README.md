### **Manual and Automation Testing:**

- **Manual Testing**:
    - Perform exploratory testing to identify usability issues and edge cases.
    - Validate all workflows manually, focusing on critical features like login, product search, cart management, and checkout.
- **Automation (Selenium)**:
    - Automate critical workflows like adding products to the cart, completing checkout, and applying promo codes.
    - Use Selenium for regression testing to ensure new updates don’t break existing functionality.
- **Cucumber Framework with POM via Selenium WebDriver**:
    - **Login Functionality :**
        - Automate login using valid and invalid credentials, checking for correct error messages.
        - Test the multi-factor authentication (MFA) process for login security.
    - **Product Search and Filters:**
        - Automate product searches and ensure that filters such as category, price, and rating return the correct results.
        - Validate the sorting functionality (e.g., price, best sellers).
    - **Checkout Process:**
        - Automate adding items to the cart and completing checkout.
        - Use Cucumber to automate applying promo codes and verifying correct discount calculations.
